# EE608-Project

This course project entails a comparitive study of how the results vary when discriminator sees differently pre-processed images from the dataset(s). These pre-processings will be low-level digital image processing algorithms which this course is centered around.   

## Papers to be replicated:   
1. GAN (Ian Goodfellow, 2014)    
2. DCGAN    
3. WGAN   
4. SRGAN 
5. Pro-GAN   
6. T-GAN    (? Or cycleGAN under cGANs)

#### cGANs:    
7. pix2pix/pix2pixHD/SPADE/SEAN
